# FrequencyBot
Produce midi file made up of random notes (within a selected key and scale) with random duration and random rests between notes (within user-defined limits)


Written for Python 2.7


Look at imports at top of FrequencyBot.py file to find dependencies.    
Probably the only one you'll need to install is [midiutil](https://code.google.com/p/midiutil/)

I think everything else comes preinstalled in most python installations.
